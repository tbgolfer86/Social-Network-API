  ## Installation
  This application uses the following node packages:<br><br>
  [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)<br>
  [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)<br>
  [mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)<br>
  [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize)

  ## Usage
  This is a node application that is invoked in the command-line. The user must first create the schema from the MySQL shell. Then the database must be seeded using the command: "npm run seed". Once the database is seeded the user can start the server by using the command: "npm start". Once the server is running, the user can retrieve data from the database by using the API endpoints that are set up in the routes directory.<br><br>
